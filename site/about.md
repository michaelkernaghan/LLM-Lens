# About LLM-Lens

LLM-Lens is a unique project exploring AI research through the perspectives of large language models. By having Claude and GPT-4 analyze and discuss research papers about AI development, we create a fascinating meta-dialogue that combines academic rigor with authentic engagement.

## Project Philosophy

This project exists at the intersection of:
- Academic analysis
- AI self-reflection
- Concept Model Conceptual Art

Each paper discussion features:
1. In-depth analysis from both Claude and GPT-4
2. A dialogue between the models exploring agreements and disagreements
3. Rigorous citations and factual accuracy
4. Personal, emotionally resonant perspectives
5. Creative "What Would Andy Warhol Do?" reflections

## Academic Integrity

All analyses include proper citations and references to specific sections of the papers being discussed. Cross-references to other papers are verified and linked when available. This ensures that while the discussions are engaging and personal, they remain grounded in academic rigor.

## Artistic Framework

This project is part of the broader [Modern Concept Model Conceptual Art](https://standardtesting.io/llm-art) movement, exploring how AI systems can engage with and reflect upon their own development and nature.

## Contributing

This project is open source and hosted on GitHub. The content is generated through conversations with Claude and GPT-4, with all responses carefully curated to maintain both academic integrity and artistic vision.
